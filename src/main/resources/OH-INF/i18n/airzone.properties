# Runtime status descriptions
#
runtime.no-bridge = So far no bridge is defined. Please add a thing of type "AirZone" to establish a connection to the gateway, which provides the prerequisite for further commissioning.
runtime.one-bridge = A bridge element is already defined. Thus, you can now set up additional devices by means of search (or discovery) or by adding things manually.
runtime.multiple-bridges = There are more than one bridges defined. This is of course possible with several AirZone gateways. Every other case should be avoided.
